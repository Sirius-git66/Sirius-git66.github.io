TWITTER INTEGRATION SETUP COMPLETE
=================================

YOUR ACCOUNT SETUP
-----------------

✓ Your Twitter account @TheArcCloud has been added to the twscrape system
✓ Account credentials are stored in accounts.txt
✓ The account is ready for daily dashboard updates

DAILY PROCESS WORKFLOW
---------------------

1. Windows Task Scheduler runs update_dashboard.bat daily at 9:09 AM
2. Script generates commodities dashboard (existing functionality)
3. Script attempts to fetch real-time news from Twitter using your account
4. If Twitter access works → uses Twitter news
5. If Twitter access blocked (Cloudflare) → automatically falls back to RSS
6. Dashboard is updated with fresh news content
7. Changes are committed and pushed to GitHub
8. Your website updates automatically

WHAT TO EXPECT
-------------

- Your dashboard will now include real-time commodities news when available
